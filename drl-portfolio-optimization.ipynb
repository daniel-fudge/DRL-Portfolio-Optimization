I wanted to thank Schulich and especially Professor Larkin for giving me the freedom to explorer the intersection of Machine Learning and Finance.   \n",

All of which are amazing projects that I highly recommend investigating."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the signals `signals.pkl` and prices `stock-data-clean.pkl` processed we can build the Reinforcement Learning algorithm.  The signals will be used to define the state of the market environment, called `observations` in the Gym documentation and `state` in other locations.  The prices will be used to generate the `rewards`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For a refresher on DRL I recommend looking through [report2](docs/report2.pdf) in this repo.  The basic RL feed back loop is shown below.    \n",

    "### Action Space\n",
    "The `action` space is simply vector containing the weights of the stocks in the portfolio.  Inside the environment these weights are limited to (0, 1) and an addition weight is added for the amount of cash in the portfolio.  The cash weight is simply one minus the sum of the other weights and also limited to (0, 1).  The last step is to normalize these weight so the sum is equal to 1.0."

    "### State (or Observation)\n",
    "The `state` is simply the signals we compiled in the previous data preparation [notebook](docs/data-preparation-no-memory.ipynb) including a time embbeding called the `window_length` within the code.  Instead of using the LSTM discussed previously, we are using a short Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) to capture some historical information from the data within the `agent`."

    "### Agent\n",
    "For the agent we are using the [RL Coach](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach#batch-reinforcement-learning) from Intel AI Labs that is integrated into AWS [Sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/reinforcement-learning.html#sagemaker-rl).  As you can see below there are a large number of RL algorithms to choose from.  In  [report2](docs/report2.pdf) we discussed serval of these and focused on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) Actor-Critic method however for this test we are trying the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm that is explained nicely by Jonathan Hui [here](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-proximal-policy-optimization-ppo-explained-77f014ec3f12) and the original paper by Schulman et al. [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf).    \n",

    "Remember that the goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the sum of discounted rewards, which in our case will result in the maximization of the portfolio value.\n",

    "#### Tweaks to Agent\n",
    "If you are playing with the number of signals you may have to change the input to the Agent.  Unfortunately one of the disadvantages of using pre-built frameworks is the extra overhead and the difficulity finding the little details you need to tweak.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have to define input, which for us is a 2D CNN or Conv2D as a RL Coach [input embedder](https://nervanasystems.github.io/coach/design/network.html) but it is actually passed to the Conv2D within Apache [MXNet].   The RL Coach [code](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach/blob/master/rl_coach/architectures/layers.py) that passes the arguments to the MXNet Conv2D [code](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2D.html) only accepts the 3 arguments and the MXNet infers the rest.  This lack of control makes setting up the problem a little tricky.  Also for time series data the MXNet [Conv1D](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv1D.html) would be more appropriate but RL coach doesn't give us the flexibility.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The interface to RL Coach is defined in `preset-portfolio-management-clippedppo.py` shown below.  The line you may want to tweak is under \"Agent\" and contains the Conv2D argument.  This needs to coorespond to the observation space definition and how the observation is pulled from the signals in the `portfolio_env.py` file shown below as well.  Both of these are in the `src` folder."
